    "### Anatomy of a time series process\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series processes have a wide variety of patterns. So it is helpful to consider them as a combination of *systematic* and *unsystematic* components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Systematic**: These are recurring in nature and so can be described and modeled.\n",
    "- **Non-systematic**: These are random in nature and so cannot be directly modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The systematic components can be further split into *level*, *trend*, and *seasonality* whereas the non-systematic component is referred to as *noise*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: The average value of the process.\n",
    "- **Trend**: The direction and rate of change of the process. The slope is a good proxy for it.\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Deviations in the process caused by recurring short-term cycles.\n",
    "- **Noise**: The random variation observed in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful abstraction while analyzing time series processes is to see them as either an *additive* or a *multiplicative* blend of the four constituent parts mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additive model**: The process $X(t)$ has the form\n",
    "$$X(t) = Level + Trend + Seasonality + Noise$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an additive model when the underlying process under examination has the following characteristics.\n",
    "- The process changes remain constant over time (i.e. they are linear). So the trend line would be straight.\n",
    "- It shows linear seasonality. That is to say the frequency and amplitude (i.e. the width and the height) of the cycles remain constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplicative model**: The process $X(t)$ has the form\n",
    "$$X(t) = Level \\times Trend \\times Seasonality \\times Noise$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a multiplicative model when the underlying process under examination has the following characteristics.\n",
    "- The process changes vary over time (i.e. they are non-linear in nature).\n",
    "- An exponential or quadratic or higher order polynomial process is multiplicative. So the trend-line would be curved, not straight. \n",
    "- It shows non-linear seasonality. That is to say the frequency and amplitude (i.e. the width and the height) of the cycles vary over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the (harsh) real world, we often encounter non-linear or even mixed processes and therefore have to work with the multiplicative model as our prototype. But we prefer to work with linear processes as they are easier to use. So we transform the original process into a linear one. A commonly used trick is applying a log transformation."

    "There are several available libraries (ex. [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html), [`fbprophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html), [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html), [`PyFlux`](https://pyflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [`fecon236`](https://github.com/MathSci/fecon236), [`PM-Prophet`](https://github.com/luke14free/pm-prophet) at the time of this writing) in Python to develop sophisticated time series models for forecasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "We work with `statsmodels` and `fbprophet` here. Both offer convenient routines to automatically decompose a time series into their fundamental components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the ideas, we make use of the daily historical prices of crude oil (from 2003 to 2020) and soybean (from 2000 to 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The OPEC Reference Basket (ORB), also referred to as the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ex. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq) Basket, is a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends produced by OPEC members. It is used as an important benchmark for crude oil prices. The OPEC Basket, including a mix of light and heavy crude oil products, is heavier than both Brent crude oil, and West Texas Intermediate crude oil.* - [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opecbasket.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The soya bean is a species of legume and is one of the worldâ€™s most important oil plants, since around half of vegetable oil produced is obtained from the soya bean. It is particularly significant because of its protein content (39 per cent) and its oil content (17 per cent), since no other plant offers comparable values. Soya is also used as an ingredient and additive in the food industry. It is estimated that around 30,000 foods contain ingredients derived from soya. Soya milk can be produced from ground yellow soya beans, and then can be processed into tofu. Tofu is used as a meat substitute in vegetarian cookery because of its high protein content and because it contains all the essential amino acids.* - [Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/soybeans-price/usd)\n",

    "In exponential smoothing, the forecasts are a weighted sum of past observations wherein the weights decrease exponentially as we move further into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Simple Exponential Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most suited for a series that does not exhibit any clear trend or seasonality.\n",
    "- We use a level-smoothing factor, $\\alpha$, to set the rate at which the weight assigned to past observations decay. It takes a value between $0$ and $1$. In `statsmodels`, its called `smoothing_level`.\n",
    "- The higher the value of $\\alpha$, the more weight is assigned to observations in the recent past. The lower the value of $\\alpha$, the more weight is assigned to observations in the distant past. \n",
    "- In the degenerate case of $\\alpha = 1$, the forecast for the next observation is the most recent observation (i.e. all weight assigned to the latest observed value and no weight to any of the previous observations).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Holt's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extension of the SES method to account for trend (but not seasonality) in a time series\n",
    "- We use a trend-smoothing factor, $\\beta$ which takes a value between $0$ and $1$. In `statsmodels`, its called `smoothing_slope`.\n",

    "#### Method IV : Modeling time series using ARIMA models\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** class of models is a popular statistical technique in time series forecasting. It exploits different standard temporal structures seen in time series processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.* - [Source](#hyndman)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Crash course on ARIMA***\n",
    "We will now take a brief look at its key features by taking apart the acronym.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Auto Regressive (AR)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression of a time series process onto itself (its past versions)\n",
    "- A time series process is $AR$ if its present value depends on a linear combination of past observations.\n",
    "- In financial time series, an $AR$ model attempts to explain the mean reversion and trending behaviours that we observe in asset prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrated (I)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a time series process ${X_t}$ recorded at regular intervals, the difference operation is defined as $$\\nabla X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference operator (denoted by $\\nabla$) can be applied repeatedly. For example, \n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 X_t = \\nabla X_t - \\nabla X_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- A time series process is integrated of order $d$ (denoted by $I(d)$), if differencing the observations $d$ times, makes the process stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moving Average (MA)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  A time series process is $MA$ if its present value can be written as a linear combination of past error terms.\n",
    "- $MA$ models try to capture the idiosyncratic shocks observed in financial markets. We can think of events like terrorist attacks, earnings surprises, sudden political changes, etc. as the random shocks affecting the asset price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the ARIMA class to model a time series process, each of the above components are specified in the model as parameters (with the notations $p$, $d$, and $q$ respectively). \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the classification $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ process can be thought of as $$AR(p)I(d)MA(q)$$ \n",
    "Here,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $p$: The number of past observations (we usually call them *lagged terms*) of the process included in the model.\n",
    "2. $d$: The number of times we difference the original process to make it stationary.\n",
    "3. $q$: The number of past error terms (we usually call them *lagged error terms* or *lagged residuals*) of the process included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we model our time series process with the ARIMA class, we implicitly assume that the underlying data generating process (and by extension the observations we record) is an ARIMA process. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should validate our assumptions (especially the implicit ones which slip under the radar) and recognize the limitations of our models. A well-known deficiency of ARIMA applications on financial time series is its failure to capture the phenomenon of volatility clustering. However, despite their inaccurate point estimates, they give rise to informative confidence intervals.\n",
